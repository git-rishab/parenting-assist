She can’t talk to anyone without fear. ","completion":"You can try 3 things:\n1. Asking child why she is not asking questions? She could say that she did ask in the school but teacher scolded back. Whatever she says, you may listen. It is possible that she says no because she is scared. \n2. Then you may say her that you can ask any question to mommy. Mom will not scold her. Even if you did in the past, it will not repeat. This way, your daughter will have one person to whom she can ask questions. \n3. Check the school once whether they allow students to ask questions or not."}

{"prompt":"So the thing is, I’ve a 1 year old. When he was hit by something or got hurt or when he falls down, immediately my family members start hitting that object so that he calms down. I’m not liking this behaviour. They are failing to understand a point that eventually he starts blaming someone else or something else if anything goes wrong instead of regulating his emotions. No matter how many times I try to express this to my family members, they brush it off and say that they’ll learn slowly when they get bigger😐","completion":"Try this - rather than advising. Ask them questions to chat up, don’t go with a closed mind. For eg why do you hit the other thing, where did you learn this from"}
{"prompt":"How I can make my child wake up early to school. She just wakes up at 7 am where her school is for 8. And top of that she is a picky eater. Needs atleast 40 min of time for breakfast itself. I start waking her up from 6. This is becoming our daily thing. I'm helpless and showing frustration on her. I want to change this situation. What can I do","completion":"i faced similar thing with my daughter. We did couple of things\n- slept on time the previous day\n- spoke to our daughter that we need to leave for school at X time. And before that she has to\n- get ready\n- eat food\n\nAfter that, my daughter completely changed. She does needs some reminder. But 90% is gone because she knows that if she doesn’t get ready and her school has a cut off time of 8.45am. And if she doesn’t get school on time, she will have to spend a day at home when all her friends will be at school. So actually, there is sense of agency. And this is what we need to activate in every child. Their own sense of agency to do things. We can’t keep pushing them. Then the sense of agency goes away. So you need to take a step back and let the child be responsible."}
{"prompt":"my son is 9 yrs old he loves only old songs like mere saamne waali kidki types? I don't noe whether his choices will affect further!","completion":"It’s ok I guess. If you want him to explore other genres then you can play them at home and see if he picks up something!\nAnd in the same genres are so many nice songs like Tera Mujhse hai pehle ka nata koi, uthein sab ke kadam. You could explore them as well.\n\nWhen the same kid becomes 14-15 years old, stop listening to his parents and only does what his friends do. So parents tell him you only do what your friends are telling. Can’t you think for your ownself.\n\nAnd now when your child is younger. when he is different and we think why is he different and not like other kids. So a lot of these things are in the heads of parents."}

This was the first time she did this... Please help.","completion":"what has happened has happened. She lost her cool, you lost yours :-) that’s ok.\nYou can give her a hug and say sorry to her for hitting. And tell her that you love her.

{"prompt":"Very good way of explaining that we don’t have to be worried about tantrums..\nbut on the other hand what about those kids who are always obedient and never assert on wanting a particular thing. My 3 year old is and has always been “that good child” who always listens me. Always submits. I try not to show domination. But how can I make this child a strong head and decisive adult who knows what she wants and how to get it.","completion":"Humera ji - we can do two things- follow our child which means to observe her without correcting etc- look at the environment particularly ourselves to see that we are not unknowingly creating an environment which is creating submission for e.g. are other women in the house submissive to men, or does someone talk harshly to her\n\nOverall there is place in the world for all kinds of us. And she seems like a wonderful natured girl."}
{"prompt":"I hav found that u understand d subconscious mind of d child .\nI hav a request pls can u tell when to start preschool or play school for kids - i mean what age n everyone tells it's normal if they cry for first few days .\nI want to kno how does psychology works of a child ....\nI couldn't see my child crying her heart out bcoz she dint wanted to go n everyone told me I'm over pampering her n let her cry ....\nIt will b gr8 if u could spare some time n answer my query","completion":"Vishakha ji, kids cry for a lot of reasons.- first few days, they can have separation anxiety. If you have it when you go to drop her, she will sense it. So imp for you to be calm- say you are leaving from your house for school and she says mumma i dont want to go, starts to cry a bit and to keep her calm you say we are not going to school but then you do go to school, she starts crying again. So our lying is contributing to her crying. We should 100% stop lying.It is imp to see that the school has the right environment for the child. That means - place to play, free play, to run around, loving teachers. A good play school can help a child make friends and be comfortable in the company of others apart from parents.What is most imp for your child to know is that you are there for her. And that you will come back to pick her. Once she feels secure she will be ok"}
{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet,😀 I've started following your channel very recently after it popped up as a suggestion while scrolling. I am glad that it showed up!😃 because I really like the way you are sharing your thoughts, analysis of child behavior patterns and also sharing important parenting tips in detail which are much needed for this gen working parents. I'm conciosuly trying my best to inclucate Montenssori method of teaching and raising a chid with gentle and respectful parenting. Din't know how simple and effetive these methods are in raising an independent and empathetic generation. Though very exhausting compared to traditional parenting method we were brought up with, it's very rewarding as it's scientific and extremely respectful way of treating another individual. Thank you soo much ❤️for making time to share your knowledge on this platform to help us new gen parents stay more educated on these topics! 😇on a side note, I keep getting asked questions many times by my family and friends to justify the parenting style I'm trying to follow and insisting them also to practice, and without thorough research and understanding myself I feel it hard to be convinced to implement any practice.one such is kid hitting and I have understood how yelling or scolding the child for hitting doesn't help in their growth and informing them that it's hurting others, giving them options to use their hands for other activities than hitting, taking them to safe space , giving them time to calm down etc.. slowly has actually helped in making my child to hit less.. but the question I got back is \" how do you handle when your child gets hit by some other child at school? how will you prevent it? by making him all empathetic and gentle won't he be too sensitive? shoudl he not hit back if someone is bullying him or hitting him?\" can you please help me in getting answers to these. I've tried searching but not got any solid answers yet. If you already have reels on this, can you please share it or any other links anytime you are free .. it'd be very helpful ! 😇","completion":"Nandhitha - thank you for your message.

Adults (teachers etc) can be involved as well👍\n\nA loving child is not a sensitive child. When we hit a child the only thing a child learns is 'the person hitting me does not love me' and he bottles up anxiety."}
{"prompt":"I have lot of confusion going in my head. My son is 6yr old. He is happy to go to school. We have put him to a Montessori school of 10yr old. My son isn't learning enough for 1st grade.

I am in a fear of not getting seat in other school as years pass, so I want to do it this year. What is your opinion. Kindly let me know🙏","completion":"This question is best asked to the teacher or founder of school. Because in Montessori children can learn at their own pace so it is possible when he starts taking interest in maths he will do 2 years of maths in 3 months. But it is imp that the Montessori school is right.👍\n\nAlso see Aavishkaar. They learn online course for parents to learn mathematics.

{"prompt":"Hello. I like your content on parenting. It’s feels very honest and not off the mill type of parenting tips we are seeing all over the Internet.I’m going through a tough time in my life. I will be divorcing my covert narcissistic husband of 11 years. I’m at loss at how I will handle my soon to be 7 year old daughter. How I will break the news to her.?How I will answer her qs ?She is too young to understand in what way her father is not good for us and I don’t want to burden her with things which are beyond her understanding.She has a very strong sense of what a family should be like even though I have a strong support system from my parents.The normal rule of thumb that one should never speak bad about your ex husband / both parents should sit down and talk with your child about the divorce usually doesn’t work in cases when one parent is toxic and doesn’t seem quite interested in being in the child’s life other than for the sole reason of social image.I know you haven’t covered parenting in abnormal situations in your blog yet. But maybe in your research if you can find any solution, it will be of great help to me.I have been reading books, messaging therapists. But haven’t find any solution yet.Thanks for reading through such a long msg. So far I have thought of telling her that her father will be staying at her grandparents house to take care of them bcz they are old and a bit sick.But it’s a lie. And maybe it’s a type of gaslighting ( to which I had been subjected to for 11 years ) which I don’t want to do to my child. But it will also buy me some time to protect her from immediate anxiety. And she will have something to tell to her friends. Maybe.","completion":"thank you for writing your heart outYou are already thinking, doing so much for your child.Each child is different. Their attachment to parents is different. I don't know all that so I will try to answer with what I would have doneI would have said, mummy and papa will be living separately from now on.Why?Because we want to. (or you can give a simple reason here)You can still meet him when you like. And I will always be here for youKids can sense anxiety. So the key part for you is to be comfortable with your own decision. When she sees her mother comfortable, it could be easier for herAnother thing you could do is educate her about different types of families in the world. 2 girls raising a kid, 2 boys, you can see Modern Family show where 2 fathers are raising a kid.But lead from there. Her concerns might just be simple ones of self preservation. So listen and simply answer. I hope this helps"}
{"prompt":"I just saw your video on Linkedin about negative effects on children due to hitting them which is really informative and insightful.

The child has grown already stubborn and manipulative over these years.","completion":"What you are describing is a situation which could take a lot of effort to revive. I will strongly suggest to take help of a therapist or child psychologist. TheFamilytree in Delhi is one place I know which can help. I am sure there are other good places. Apart from considering therapy personally I would have started by saying sorry to the child. And finding connection time with him. Go on a vacation with the child. That’s the start. To build trust again. Which will take time. "}

{"prompt":"To begin with , I love watching your content , having an seven year old daughter , I resonate with each and every video you make.\nI recently saw the video on schools, much against my wishes , my in laws and my husband put my daughter in Kendriya Vidyalaya. I have studied in a reputed ICSE boarding school and my heart sinks when I see my daughter going to KV as I feel peers matter and for the sheer reason that I want my child to have better than what I had.\nPros of KV : inclusive environment , children with specials needs are also a part of the same classroom.\nEquality : all students are treated equal , no special treatment to any officers child\nImportance given to sports and the down to earth environment, such as eating lunch in the playground etc.\nCons : communication skills , not very modern ways of teaching , and may be the kind of peers I grew up with , I learnt a lot of mannerisms and habits, I don't see that in this environment.\nWhat's your say ? Am I wrong?","completion":"Hi Nishka, you have very nicely described the pros and cons.Wrong and right are perceptions. What you are choosing is an environment for your child.

Small kids can't sit and eat so he might just roam around. And may be eat and may be not eat- you can put some healthy food at his eye level so that he can pick anytime and take it - fruits etc- ensure that he does not get junk food later if he asks- finally involve him in the process of cooking, cutting (wooden knife etc)And trust his animal instinct. We are animals, we will eat when we are hungry. There is no way to go without it. Don't let your anxiety of mera beta nahin kha raha come into pictureand don't use mobile/TV :-)"}
{"prompt":"As a curious parent just reaching out for some help, my daughter will turn 4 next month - she is completely potty trained but of late she has been wetting herself be it during the day at home or outside even at night. After talking to her she says she is scared but I fail to understand the reason of being scared to say she wants to use the washroom. Would love to hear back if any suggestions/opinions/answer","completion":"Hi Romayne - \n\nThank you for writing. One good information to have would have been - has there been any change of routine for your child?\n\nBut here are a few reasons I can think of.\nsometimes girl children get UTI which makes it difficult to control pee\nor there is pain happening while peeing so they control it till they no longer can\nyou could get it checked with a doctor\n\nsecond could be that the reason is emotional which is high probability coz she says she is scared. The reason this happens is generally if there has been a change in routine. Like you have started going to work or she saw a movie which was scary or if she has been ill or someone close has been ill, there is a new school or nanny.\n\nThe key part is this: being potty trained is not about making a mess or not. It is a way for a child to feel confident that this is my body, I can control it. So what is imp is that you or noone else makes her feel that there is a problem. \n\nLike 'Arey beta, why are you doing this, you were potty trained, then now why this'. This means you are pointing a fault in her. \n\nIf incident happens you can just calmly help her. And for the things she is scared you can go with her. If the reason is emotional then as she becomes more comfortable with the new order it will go away on its own once she gets used to the new routine"}

Please help me how can I make my son understand that he has to play within his limits.","completion":"Well your child wants to play that’s great actually!He is not looking to go see more tv mobile but actually play! A few things that come to my mind - I wish parents would leave kids alone to solve this.

And sometimes others don’t want to play, right. He nodsHow does that make you feelAngryI understandI understand you want to play so badly. But we will not use our hands and feetWe will not use our hands and feet. Anothe replace to do this conversation is just before he is going to play with his friends. Also you can find him alternate ways to spend energy, outdoor play etc. Other friends who have more energyYour child is fantastic! He just wants to play :-) You only have to help him express his feelings better. And all of this is assuming that his mobile time, screen time is <30 min a day.

{"prompt":"Due to the frequent transfers my kids have to change their schools almost every 2 years. My elder one is 7. And now she is going to one school where kids brings fancy stuff like pencils and scented erasers. She thinks if she also gets these kind of things she will get more friends. Should we really give her whatever she is asking. Because in last two weeks she has stolen few things from her peers. Which she hid from me and kept in her cupboard. Though asked her to return and met her class teacher regarding this. Very confused how to act in such situations where we can’t really be very harsh too though have warned her in a very stern way.","completion":"Here are two things that you could do\n- one is sternness won't help. If we shout at the child the next time the child may be just won’t tell you and hide it from you. - see this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3zbzRvaC_Q\n- at the same time it is imp to tell her we don’t take things that belong to others. You can give an example of how would she feel if someone took something that belonged to her. You can say this without making her feel that she is a thief. Because she is just excited by seeing the pencils and erasers. - each parent can have different ways to share what they feel is right with the child but the most important bit is to talk to the child with love and care. - Finally you could set a pocket money say 500 rs for month and say this is yours, you save 100 rs in the bank and spend 400 on whatever you want. So she now has some money to buy things for her self and can learn from financial lietracy as well on her own. Please do remember - moving every few years can be hard for kids so give her big hugs :-)"}

Hi I just asked for help frm one of my frnds... but seems u may help me out though...Plz through some light","completion":"For most questions like this we should try to listen rather than react.

Why do you need to put a negative connotation in his head - that don't let friends call you gay.\n\nlet it be. Gay is not a matter of someone calling and we will become.

Earlier he would eat, and be interested .. now he just does not take a bite of anything. It's too difficult to make him try to eat without distraction - like one of ur post was about screen time with meal,But here we have to mayeb tell him a story, or rhyme - because we haven't started his screen yet","completion":"Throwing is normal for kids - he is just trying to understand gravity and develop his finger grip. Just create a bucket of things he can throw. That works best. But this is the need of the childOn food you have to trust that we are animals and when we are hungry we will eat. It is great you don't use screen. Involve him in meal preparation if you can or grandmother can, small tasks. Plus dont expect him to sit and eat. he can be moving and eating and can take his time. Also fruits can be kept at his eye level so that when he is hungry he can pick during the day. On your first one don't doubt your need. Separation anxiety is real. Spend time with the child where you are completely with him no phone, because you have in laws it seems like you are able to work easily, which is great. You can go outdoors, you can do a trip together, whatever helps both of you feel connected. The key is not to be anxious :-) He is lucky to have the love of both his mother and grandmother"}

{"prompt":"Hii can you make a video on pros and cons of convent schools. Like i have 2 daughters they are going in convent school one of my friend told me that convent is not good there is attraction to boys in future because it's only girls school n ol","completion":"Hi Sheetal - if we keep looking at all one by one, it will never end. So the idea is understand the child and understand what we want for our child. For e.g. isn't human attraction normal and necessary. Why should it be a bad thing? Do we have to live in society together, both male and female? Then why should we separate them at school, get them to sit separate etc. Now this does not mean all girl schools are bad. Your daughters could get a chance to come home and play with the opposite sex. And that's ok too. Personally I would prefer my daughter to go to a school where both boys and girls go. Because she can then learn and interact with both. Hope this helps"}
{"prompt":"Hi, your content is very helpful and the story you recently shared on insta on mud getting struck in girls hair is very enlightening. Please do share tips on how to discourage thumb sucking. My kid is 18 months and thumb sucking has increased crazily after stopping breastfeeding. He is hurting his thumb because of this.","completion":"Akhila, here's my view. Thumb sucking is a way for your child to feel secure. Earlier breastfeeding gave him that feeling, now thumb sucking is giving him that feeling. My understanding is that this is only a problem is it continues beyond the age of 5 when permanent teeth are coming. Till then what you can do is two things- you can see when does the child do this, is it in a particular setting or environment, for e.g. when you are about to leave or at a particular time of the day. Essentially observe over react.Honestly you can absolutely ignore it, chill :-), let him be soothed. Maximum you can smile at your child, touch the child and gently remove the thumb. So now the child is being soothed by your presence. Hope this helps.LikeForwardCopyUnsendPlease do let me know what happens"}
{"prompt":"Just wanted to know that does hyperactive kids have a speech delay?\n\n—\nHyperactive means he is too energetic..doesnot sit much unless some interesting stuff is given to himHe is 3 years oldRecently we did his assessment and he has slight delay in speech and language delayHe speaks 2 or 3 words sometimes but doesnot make proper sentencesHe use to watch 2 hours a day but we have completely stoped since a monthLikeForwardCopyReportThank you so much for replying","completion":"Can you tell me a little more about your kid. What does hyperactive mean? What kind of speech delay?How old is he?How much time does he watch cartoon?\n\n\n—\nOne imp bit here is that some children do need help. If you think that is the case and you are feeling anxious about it - take the help of a speech therapist. Go for one session and see how you feel with what they say. Overall you have now started on the right path so don't worry. don't be anxious :-) the children can sense it and then feel there is something wrong in them but they are only the product of the environment that we made for them. Most speech delays happens because the child is not getting enough practice to speak. The child learns language through practice and that is missing. Practice is generally missing because of two main reasons. First is high cartoon time. I have now spoken to, chatted with multiple parents who wrote about speech delay for their child and in 80% cases the reason seems to be 2-3 hours of cartoon time a day.The second biggest reason practise is missing is that the parents are busy and we are not talking to our child enough. Not smiling, looking into the eyes and engaging with the child. This is leading to delay in speech.So- stop cartoon time- talk to him more often, hug him more- take him outdoors to play. And I think in 2 months you could see wonderful results.. Go in nature as much as you can, stop timezone, malls etc. Does that make sense?"}

Does well mean having the confidence to follow one's own path, does well mean feeling emotionally safe and secure, does well mean becoming a CEO of a company or being in a highly paid job even if you know I don't love doing it.So the question really is what does 'well' mean for the parentLikeForwardCopyUnsendFor me 'well' means- having the confidence to pursue your choices. Not getting bogged down by what society feels or wants you to do.- being resilient in doing what you are doing, not giving up easily- having a kind heart, learning to live with all kinds of people who look, feel different than us- being healthy - being able to understand their own body, food, need for exerciseThat's my personal choice :-), you have to make yours"}
{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet ji.. my elder son is 10 year old, and i think he is in the right age to understand the timings when to do what, like brushing, bathing, sleeping and waking up for school. But these little little things he needs to be called out for so many times, which make me lose patience and i have tried not to asking it for a whole day just to see when he feels it's time to brush but it takes him hours to realise and then he does that...what should I do?","completion":"Hitanshi, all of us crave sense of agency which is feeling of control over actions and their consequencesBut if it has been taken away it can take time to come back. How is it taken away? By too much talking, too many reminders, too much pushing around to do what the adult wants the child to doHow can it be brought back? By giving freedom but by setting the right environment.So what is the right environment?To create the right environment what you need to do is sit down with him, hug him, tell him we love you so much. And I think you can do things yourself and I don't want to follow up with you. So let's together make rules of the house. These rules have to be made together and have to be simple. For e.g. coming home for dinner at 7, TV time of 30 min, brushing and bathing, leaving for school at X time.And they have to be done with him, like you could write them together. This can only happen well when you do it with lot of love and care but firmness.And then you can support him - by waking him up once. It is possible he might miss school a few days, a week. The rule then is that at home there can not be any TV, he can play by himself so that others can do their own work.But finally his sense of agency should return.You could think about why is brushing so imp to you, let him feel how it feels to not brush for 7 days. Let's see what happens? The only thing you need to do is tell him lovingly that iske baad waapis daant nahin aayenge agar kharaab ho gaye to.I hope this helpsplease do tell me what happensLikeForwardCopyUnsendfeel free to ask"}

Preschools/Playschools: How to choose a pre school? What is important for children under age of 6 y?What do kids do in pre-school? Karte kya hai.

Along with that walking into the environment had a positive feeling with the way it was laid out. It was bright, clean, big windows with light streaming in. So both of them combined. If you read a bit on Montessori then you will be able to understand better. For e.g. you could pick one of the following books Montessori method (first two chapters are hard), Discovery of childhood or Secret of childhood - read chapter 4 and 5.

Is it a joint family? Because of small child, is the attention of the adults been taken away from the 3 year old to the 1.8 years old?\n\nOk. The kid who is hitting needs essentially more loveif you get upset with the older kid this behaviour will continueYou can- ignore- look at the kid, hold gently, smile and say no using hands and feet- and the parents, others can spend more 1 on 1 time with the kid who is hitting because what he/she could be lacking is a little bit of loveIn general hitting is because the kid is unable to control because the brain is underdeveloped, it's naturalHope this helps."}

That will make her feel comfortable that my parents will be hereIt is possible that some incident happened at school with a kid, teacher, ants, spiderI am just saying that lot of reasons are possible.

{"prompt":"Hello. I'm Lipika from Guwahati, Assam. I started following you as I could relate to your content as a parent. I'm texting you personally as we're in a situation which is quite confusing for us as parents.Our son is 4 yrs 10 months old. He will complete 5 years on 15th April. Recently he just completed his class Nursery (also known as LKG in some schools) and has been promoted to UKG. The confusion is right at this point you see.He studied LKG in a pre-primary school. And now we are shifting him to a bigger school where he can study till his 12th. The thing is, the bigger school did not let us admit him into UKG so we enrolled him in LKG once again. We made up our minds that our son will be 7 years when he reached Class 1.But yesterday's final PTM in his nursery school changed everything. They didn't use to have exams. Children were evaluated on a weekly basis observing their daily progress in class. His report card says that he writes well, and his oral needs practice.His teacher too appreciated about his progress. While speaking to a few other parents, we got to know that many of the children have been enrolled into UKG as per the age.At this point, we felt bad as it seems now that we are pulling our child backwards by making him repeat the same year again, just different school.Can you please advise me as to what should we do? For some people, this might not be a problem because the NEP has raised the age bar to 7 yrs for class 1. But as first time parents, we have our doubts.Kindly reply.","completion":"Hi Lipikathank you for your messageSometimes we are too close to a situation and it can feel overwhelming. For e.g. think when your child is 40 years old, will it matter whether he is in UKG or LKG?During Covid, my daughter said I don't want to do online class, so we said ok. So she didn't go to school for an year. And now all her friends are one class ahead. But she doesn't care and neither do well. But you could also talk to the teacher and say you want to shift his class to one ahead. That is ok too :-)The key part is: how is the school teaching, is your child learning joyfully, does he have enough time to play outdoors, to follow his sense of agency. Rest which standard does not matter :-)"}

My husband doesn't have any role to play actually he is a quiet person n he loves my daughter a lot n arhan my boy use to trouble her a lot siblings riverly is at peak for us so mu husband takes sarinas stand n shout at him so I guess he doesn't have a very lovable bond i guess","completion":"Naaz ji, walekum assalamSorry for replying lateAapne do teen cheezein batayi- aapke bete ko Arabi class pasand nahin hai- woh aapse aachey se baat nahin kar raha (badla)- he fights with his younger sisterAn older child generally fights with the younger one when he feels that the younger one has taken the love of his parentsSo what is imp here is to- give him lots of love and hugs- give him 1 on 1 time both from you and your husband where you can spend time only with him. So your husband can take him to playground or you could say let us play something- involving him in helping with your daughterwhat he wants is to know that he is loved by his parentsIf I was in your place I would talk to him and ask why he does not like Arabi classAnd if seems really insistent on not going, I would stop it. I will say, I love you and it is ok if you don't want to goBut that depends on why he does not want to go - it is possible it is because he feels pushed to go, it could be because teacher is not good, it could be because he sleeps late at night and feels tired in the morning, it could be because he feels mom dad want to send him outside of the house so that they can spend time with sister. A child's mind is very simple. So you can understand this. The key part is your child doesn't need your 'talks', he needs your love and hug, and warmth"}

{"prompt":"Thank you for sharing this i live in join family too although i get lot of support my my family watching the child while I'm at work my daughter has now picked up habit of biting another child at home no matter how much we try we are not able to change this habit .. there are two kids at home and we want to make sure both are not hurt .. it gets tough not knowing what to do and my daughter is only 2.5 yrs and other one is almost 4\n\nHello thank you for responding 😃 i have noticed this mostly happens as defence mechanism i think when the other child is also being mischievous and we cannot really say specific time of day and all the adults do panic they seperate the kids first and attend to the kid who is hurt and warn my child telling her not To do so. I don't usually say anything at that point and take her away while other parent can attend to bite 🥺","completion":"HI Gayathri, so when does this happen? What time of the day? What are they doing? Anything you have noticed? When this happens how do adults in the house react?\n\nThe idea is that we have to work with the child with love. The child who is biting is unable to control her emotion so if we respond with love and guide her, she will be able to control❤️so that means hugging her, talking to her telling her you really wanted that toy right?Yes mamaYa I know.I know that's why you bit. And you like playing with your brother na, I know that.But when we bite we can't play then and don't get the toy also. Hai naYes mummaI love you so much, next time you feel like getting the toy, ask, wait a little, it will come, don't bite. It doesn't help❤️A loving conversation is required where she feels understoodThis will get solved 100% Please do let me know what happens"}
{"prompt":"Hii Harpreet !!\nMy younger son he is of 2.5 years ...he bites and hit everyone he meet and he is very naughty ..after a time everyone gets irritate with his activities ...what should I do for that","completion":"Hi AartiBiting is quite natural in kids. They want to explore with their mouth, they are unable to control their emotions. So biting can happen. The clear way to address this is to just calmly say no. Give him a hug, love and say no firmly but calmly. If you get agitated and the child is able to get a reaction out of you, he will continue. And you don't need to call him naughty. If you keep calling him that, he will believe it and he will become one. We don't need to put labels, else they can become the truthhttps://www.thecuriousparent.com/podcast/my-child-is-shy\n\nOn hitting you can tell him clearly - no hitting. Firmly again but with love. I hope this helps. Please do let me know what happens"}

We have a car but use our electric 2W a lot. Use auto a lot to go short distances. Kids actually enjoy these more than cars\n- chocolates we have now started to just distribute among the people working in the building or just give away\nThese are all measures that we use.

{"prompt":"My daughter, Ima is turning four this month. She is going to nursery.In her first school, she had trouble settling, was crying throughout for over a month. The staff there had given up on her. She also started getting really anxious and started crying at night worrying about school the next day.Eventually, we moved her to another school which has more staff and also better trained. They also admit special children. The new school is quite flexible and don’t force her to do anything which is why it is working.LikeForwardCopyReportShe took a bit of time settling there as well. She used to cry while I used to drive her there. But she’s okay once I drop her there. She has trouble separation from me.Recently we started sending her in the school van with a kind ayah from the school. After that she’s more or less stopped crying.It’s very hard to distract her if she’s stuck on something or angry. She always says no first for daily tasks like brushing, bathing, feeding, potty etc. It’s tough to get through the day.But when she has my attention, she’s a happy child and she loves to do activities with me. She’s very creative.School is also happy with her. We had shown her to a child psychologist when she had issues with the first school, the psychologist had said that she didn’t see any issues with her.But her anger and stubbornness is giving me a lot of stress. She also doesn’t settle with a part time nanny I have hired. It’s just too tough to make her do anything.\n\nBoth of us are software developers and have permanent work from home .

{"prompt":"Hello sirI was going through your content and its amazing.I could actually relate every ounce of it.I have a question for you..What about childhood traumas they get when they see there parents fighting with eachother constantly?We talk about upbringing by providing everything a child wants... But what about good parenting?Because a person gets love and affection from their parents. But when you see your own parents fighting with eachother... I feel its mentally very disturbing.\n\nIn this case, what do you think a child should do?How they should handle it?\nOne is 18yrs and the other is 7yrs","completion":"Hi Khushi, the idea is not to 'provide everything the child wants'. The idea is to provide child with a loving environment so that the child can feel safe and cared for. That does not mean listening to all their wishes or agreeing with him. It just means being with them with love. Seeing parents fight can be traumatic for children. It can make them feel unsafe. It can make them feel it is because of them. It can have an impact on development of both EQ and IQ in the child.\n\nHow old is the child?\n\nThe 7 year old can't do much. The 18 year old should know that this is not because of them. She can have a conversation with her parents that what you are doing has an impact on me and the young kid in the hope that they can understand. Rest she also can't do more. Except may be think of going to hostel for college!"}

Young children 'can't sitThey are designed to not sit coz the brain learns through movement. Please do understand this. If you make him sit, learning will stop not increase. He has the desire of evolution to move.- you want to do your job- you want a clean house- you want kids to sit- in the family (your husband) you don't have time for kidsIt might sound harsh but in that case why have kids?I don't mean to say this rudely at all. But as a means for you to introspect.The issue is not with your son. The mindset change required is for you and your husband. So my question to you is: can you do the mindset change? Can you let your kids be? Not worry about a clean house? Can you take out at least 30 min for them everyday with lot of love? Can you take them out to nature? And most importantly can you not use mobile as a nanny. Your children if they continue to see mobile won't develop empathy. Their minds will be hooked to dopamine, they won't develop the concentration to study. This is a big price to pay for a clean house.I am not sure if I answered your question or raised more questions.

So any education system which helps with that is great👍There is also the need to work hard because that helps build our brain. If that can happen with love and interest then both EQ and IQ develop👍SSC board schools mostly have high teacher to student ratio which allow for less interaction. It also generally tries to teach 'ratta'. You learn this and move on👍But knowledge in the near future is going to be of now value👍What is going to be of value is to understand how things work, why a certain decision is better than others - ambiguous stuff.

{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet!I came across your page and i really liked the content. Thank for sharing.Can I ask for a help? One of your post says parenting is interfering.I agree, and i want my child to be on his own, especially play on his own.But he doesn't play anything/most of the things, until i join him, that's my struggle with him. He is 3.5yrs old. Example- jigsaw puzzle, wooden rainbow stackers, anything he pulls out to play, he insists that he wants to play with me. Often he will take out toys, not play with it, take out next in next couple of minutes and when I ask him why he didn't play with the first one, he says, i was waiting for u to join, u didn't come, so i didn't play that.... he goes to a proper montessori school, so any tips or suggestions?","completion":"Hi Aastha, my daughter was like this for the longest time.If I was in your place, I would- not ask this question why didn't you play.- be ok if the child is not playing with any toy- make my house more lively, say a swing, a hanging bar, some mud, some live creature- I will give my child time with me morning and evening and afternoon. So that the child knows that he will get my time. So that he feels connected.The more connected he feels to you, the more independent he will become. This is imp to understand. The safer he feels the more independent he becomes. So the path to him being more free is through your unconditional love.. Also having another kid from neighbourhood will also help"}

{"prompt":"Hello Sir, I have been watching ur videos as a mom of a 2.5 year old girl. Around the 2nd wave of covid, I lost my mother in law, and hence began a tough time. I being the only woman in the house was expected to do everything; chores of the house, take care of my daughter who was 1 year old then. The men were my husband , my brother in law and my father in law. All busy with their lives and I was busy with everything around. My daughter needed me but I was in a space where I was expected to match my mother in law and hence began her screen time to such an extent that she developed virtual autism and a speech delay. 1 year later now after therapies and early intervention she seems like a normal toddler, but there are still things that trouble me... if there is any guidance that I can get. She starts her preschool in June as per her age. I m worried if she will settle in.\nPlease do read\n\nShe is not very interactive with her talks ..so it's like if we ask her anything she will say Haan...It's like I am worried if she will be comfortable in school and cope with her peers\n\nWill she be fine with her peers is my concern.\n\nTrue but she likes to see it sometimes when we are on screens or sometimes..We know how bad screens can be... it was a nightmare for us..we woke up at the right time sir...Do make a video on this...parents need to know about the ill effects of screen.

What do uniforms have to do with education?LikeForwardCopyUnsendhttps://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17998361383653389/I will suggest please see the reel on choosing a school and how it is dependent on what a parent wants for the child.\n\nWorking hard is imp at every age.

{"prompt":"I just feel that in the real world, as a parent I would want my child to be aware of the concept of winning and losing. But what I would want to do is, talk to my child and normalise losing and failures, make them an acceptable thing in life! How she can learn from those slips is what matters, and how when one loses - say in a race, you can end up actually winning and discovering a lot more within!\nI know some kids, who are not able to digest their loss (not judging, just an observation). Loss of any kind- losing a friend, losing a game of tennis or a relay race; they tend to howl, hit, be aggressive as an expression of not being ok with the loss. Teaching one and all to win in the face of a loss is the important one for me. What do you say?","completion":"you have the right views. I still think that the crux of the idea is to move away from comparison.Thank you for bringing this up. I have heard parents say I will be tough with my child so that he can prepare for the world👍 but that is not how 'being tough' develops. For a child to be tough to deal with the world, the path is through love and understanding. It's the exact opposite.

{"prompt":"Hi! I am a mother of a 4 year old. He is in Nursery Class. Due to covid/lockdown situations, my kid couldn't attend a physical school at an earlier age and was directly admitted to this grade. He is almost done with Nursery, but we are still getting complaints from school about him being distracted and lately also misbehaving with other kids in school. He is improving academically. He is a happy kid, and he never cried about going to school, infact he loves going to school, but he ends up in situations where he is hitting or grabbing or smothering other kids. Not always with an intention to hurt them but is seldom understood by teachers or other kids. He has also been a very energetic kid and gets too excited about things and thus ends up behaving roughly. How can we as parents help him express himself in a better way?\nPS: I love all your videos, and i think you are doing a great job understanding the behavior of kids at a very core level.\nThanks 😊\n\nHe is not very interested in screens. He has never been, and no continuous use. He may play games on the phone for 10-15 mins n then run around. He will ask to turn on TV but not sit and watch. He would run n play n may be some particular poem catches his attention and he will watch for a few minutes and then again he would run n play.Outdoor time, he is in day boarding school and has free play time at least 1 hr in school and on most days he gets an hour of Outdoor time at home also. At home, if he wants something that is not ok ,we talk to him, and he is not a stubborn kid. He understands. And even if it is something he really wants and we have a discussion about it and if it is not too harmful we sometimes agree and if it is not we distract him and give him to get over it.LikeForwardCopyReportHe doesn't create a lot of hue and cry for anything. But he loves rough-housing. With his grandpa, he would climb on him like a monkey.\n\nHis school timings are 8 am to 3 pm. In this time they get an hours time for napping.

You have a wonderful daughter. And single parenting can be frustrating. A child’s brain’s key job is to make the child feel secure. When you say to the child I will go, the brain starts to focus on survival and hence can’t grow in higher order like learning. It’s like when our mind is not calm, then we find it difficult to work. In children it is amplified. But here’s what you can do now: you have to catch hold of your daughter and tell her listen. I told you I will go away only to get you to eat food. It was foolish of me to say that. I want you to know that I love you and no matter what happens I will ALWAYS ALWAYS be there for you❤️That is what her brain needs to hear till she is comfortable again.

{"prompt":"Hi Harpeet. We are parent of twins. I did see a video of your in dad not to wait. What happens if the child prefers only the mother/grandmother? My husband is putting efforts to bond with the child. Need your thoughts on what kind of efforts a dad needs to do when the child is less than 2years","completion":"Just being around is enough. If one is around and smiling, bonding will happen sooner or later. The father can obviously take the kids out to garden, start playing a bit with them.LikeForwardCopyUnsendMy dad used to say this about love: if I lock you in a room for 2 days with a cow, you will fall in love with the cow. Which I agree with. Yeh to hamare bache hai :-)"}
{"prompt":"Hello. I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been following you only recently and a smile spreads across my face everyone I see you support/ guide parents who are concerned about mobile usage.❤️\nReplied to your storyThis is because I live close to my parents, and am a working mother so I haven’t had much say in terms of my children’s screen time until a few months ago. Last August my parents were out of town so I took a chance and told my kids that this special Mother sons time (nearly 10 days) would be spent without the TV. I was met with a TON of resistance naturally.\nReplied to your storyAs my children(they were 4yrs old twins then) were always fed with a TV in front of them for the last 2 yrs. I would sit with them when they cried and hold them but would say that I can’t allow it because it is not okay to watch for that long. I sometimes even lied (when I had no bandwidth to explain to them during my solo parenting stint) that the TV was spoilt. It has now been 8 months. Of No TV while eating. They get about 20-30 min of tv at my uncles place which I agreed to. But that’s it.❤️\nReplied to your storyThe MAJOR benefits that we have reaped as a family include them playing far more, them having a little quiet time and focus while doing any activities at home, they are now on the way to self feeding since the last 2 months, they tell me when they’re hungry (before I wouldn’t know if they were hungry or wanted to watch TV). There’s now a lot more imaginative play and a lot more story telling. And many more subtle priceless changes in behaviour.LikeReport\nReplied to your storyThe work you’re doing is massive when you support parents to choose differently. I am thoroughly enjoying my instagram time because of parenting accounts such as you’re Sir. Have a great day.","completion":"So beautiful to hear your story!❤️"}
{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet, saw few of your videos and decided to message. I moved to Uk with my husband nearly 6-7 months back and brought along my son who had just turned 1 year old. During the first 42 days we lived in a company provided accommodation, he used to enjoy with Naani (my mom was here for 5 months) and then we shifted to another house, the house had separate floors. His screen time increased significantly sometimes even 6-7 hours In day as my husband behaved like an absent parent. Managing home, meals, new job and kid got a little difficult in the new country, I was stressed some of the times. So we stayed in uk for 5 months and then went to India for a month and realised my son is not responding like 18months old. He does not point, I never taught him pointing to be honest. is going to be 20 months tomorrow and still does not respond to his name. He loves playing, running around, responds to rhymes and songs that I sing. Loves being tickled, likes climbing on sofa and bed and stairs.He hasn’t been around any kids for the last 7 months. And his language and speech is not the same as other toddlers his age.I didn’t notice not pointing, not responding to name earlier because I thought he was distracted by tv. He eats his food himself breaking pieces, he normally does exploring the place himself so I never thought to teaching him aloud things like “give” or “take” or go. He is very careful about his safety and would find ways to walk safely, crawls if he thinks the floor is very uneven, changes way of walking if he sees he might fall. He is definitely aware of his surroundings. He likes to be around males more and has no problem making eye contact with most of the people. He is shy around femalesI am worried about a few things:1. He is not responding to name2. Not pointing out himself (does give other cues and grunts if he wants things and sees I have them)3. Does not imitate enough4. I have not given him screen time mostly after 10th Feb and see changed in his eye contact, his eye contact is definitely improving but does not respond if called. Could you please help with some directions 🙏","completion":"Preeti ji, you seem to have a wonderful child who loves playing, running around❤️Screen time can have a devastating affect on the child's brain but below the age of 2 years most of it is recoverable.So stop stressing, give him as much love and hugs as you can. And engage with him, get him company of kids. Observe hiim, notice him without interfering.Also I am not a physician or a doctor. So if something is really worrying you please go for a visit to a paediatrician. But overall stop worrying, start spending carefree loving time with your son, involve him in house activities a bit and see him blossom! You did a great job by stopping screen. Kudos"}

{"prompt":"Hello, I came across your page just today. The first podcast that I listened to was “ my child is shy”. I literally had goosebumps thinking about how many times we break the spirit of our child by letting people judge them and put labels on them. I have gone through this recently to an extent that I was anxious about my child all the time, eventually landing up with health issues myself. She is just 6 years old. Earlier a very extrovert and outspoken personality and now strong willed, spontaneous but like to spend time with herself. First time we got worried about her was when we saw her picnic pictures in which she wasnt smiling and sat away from all. She is a deep observer and likes to go slow but it pained our heart when we saw her interest losing away from school because she probably felt hurt due to some kind of peer pressure I believe. Just sharing all this with you to share the extent to which child can get stressed. Could you please elaborate more on how to understand","completion":"Hi Neha, thank you for your messageYou have been observing your child which is good.

{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet, I really like what you share about parenting. There is one thing that constantly bothers me.

{"prompt":"My 4year daughter is not able to identify colour. Even after telling 10 times it is yellow colour she would say orange colour. What should I do","completion":"Hi Chhaya, First of all don't worry :-)You don't need to ask her 10 times. She need not feel that because she sees the world differently than you, she is lesser than othersAll of us see the world differentlyIt is possible that she is colour vision deficient. And that's ok.You can do the below test. Please read and see---To give yourself a basic indication of whether there might be a problem with your child’s colour vision, get a sheet of white paper and a basic set of colouring pencils – at least 12 different colours but including green, red, brown, orange, blue, purple and grey. Use mid-range shades, not too pale or too dark– and shade an area of about 2cm by 2cm of each colour onto the paper. Make sure that the colours are in random order and that you don’t have all the reds or greens together, but do place red, green and brown adjacent to each other. Take the paper and your child to an area with good natural light (but not a bright light, artificial light or strong sunlight) and make up a fun game which involves asking your child to identify all of the colours on the sheet. Do not show them each colour individually, they must be able to see all of the colours at the same time.If your child shows signs that they are not sure whether a colour is red, green, brown, purple, blue or grey, there is a reasonable chance that they are red/green colour blind. Before you start ask them which colours are the easiest for them to identify. You should expect a red/green colour-blind child to be able to identify bright blue and yellow (they can identify these colours by brightness and shade). Make sure you include these colours so that they do not get the impression that they aren’t clever enough for the game. Just do this once with love. And share back. Again don't make your child feel that just because she sees the world differently something is wrong with her!"}

{"prompt":"Plz make any video for thumb sucking","completion":"Hi Vrinda, will do. But here are my thoughts- The idea is that your child has a brain pattern set for soothing. Earlier breastfeeding gave the child that feeling, now thumb sucking is giving the child that feeling. As the teeth become sharp the child will find alternate ways. So it is only a problem if it continues beyond the age of 5 when permanent teeth are coming. Till then what you can do is two things.- Firstly you can see when the child does this, is it in a particular setting or environment, for e.g. when you are about to leave or at a particular time of the day. Essentially observe over reacting to the situation.- And if you want to you can smile at your child, touch the child, and gently remove the thumb. So now the child is being soothed by your presence.- If I was you, I would ignore it, and let the child be soothed."}

Should I still ignore?LikeForwardCopyReportRight now, i just move away from her to a different room","completion":"She could have learnt from a cartoon or seeing somewhere else.It's ok. Children hit only because they don't know how else to express.You could ignore it as in all the adults could ignore itLikeForwardCopyUnsendOr you can lovingly say to her - you want your toy, no hitting, ask for it. You can practise this a few times\n\nYou don't need to fully go away. You can say no gently with a smile. If you want to move away you can say - we don't use hands and feet to talk. I love you, when you are ok, I will come back again"}
{"prompt":"Harpeeet your content is always so easy to digest and practical, I would want to ask one question where I am struggling with my 4 Yr old daughter, she is not ready to be alone or play independently even for a sec, we do our best to give her our time we are not in I did so we have good work life balance 5 baje office band to band.\nOnly TV is something she can do alone and that I don't let her watch, TV watching is so minimal at our home, now engaging her, with 2nd baby coming, no house help, full time office work. I am loosing my temper , I keep q lot of patience a lot Trust me but now a days I can't handle her she is crying for only pink dress, not listening even after many polite reminders...\n\nNot listening anything not giving me time for 30 mins also , just always and always around I can't talk to any one can't do what I am doing there is constant mumma no independent play nothing everything has to be with mumma , she is doing this from very long and new baby arrival I told her this week. So new baby and this problem is not related.","completion":"HiCongratulations on becoming a mother againThe truth is the older child needs you nowCoz a new child is coming and she will be afraid of losing your loveSo when you lose your temper you make her fears come trueYour child needs your loveLet her be closeAnd let her wear whatever dress she wants to who cares if it’s the same dress for 10 days?LikeForwardCopyUnsendThe idea is for her to feel secure she needs love. She needs to know her mother is there\n\nSure. But it will increase + it will easily transform to hitting the new child.😲The idea to understand is this can be because of two reasons- you have not given too much time so the child wants your time to fill her cup of love- you have given too much time so she hasn't gotten enough experiences to build more confidence to be on her ownLikeForwardCopyReport\n\nIn both cases the path is through love which means - being welcome towards her. That is step one. Once she feels secure she will leave you. So being welcoming and getting new experiences as in having another child at home for play date, she going somewhere else, going out to the park and then letting her be around you. Small steps she will take to move away from you as she becomes confident that my mother is there"}

The child had no such need. This idea of comparison is dangerous in the long run. Because comparison can easily become the root cause of stress, anxiety in life. Like having a better car than my neighbour, getting promotion faster than others etcThe critical bit is: we have conditioned him to this position. He wasn’t born like this. So what can we do now.- He is 4. you can hold him, hug him and tell him listen it is imp for you to know that coming first is not imp, it is imp that you gave your best. Coming first does not matter to us.- is there any need to celebrate at all? there is no need, what you can do is hug him irrespective of what position he gets- if he throws a tantrum when he loses, don't react with oo dont cry etc. Just be there for him, again hug helps, holding hands help. Asking did you try your best helps. They will easily stop if you don't react to them- Finally you could find some books which you can read to him around this. I will try to search and share- First is not to react to the tantrum- stay calm, chill and move forward.

So i didn't had a chance to start my career. Before I had many goals but after becoming parent I don't know why I just don't want to get out of house leaving my children. I just want to parent them myself as long as I can .My parents said we will look after ur children u go and earn money so that they canHave a good life without any financial problems.My husband also asking me to look for a job as it can help him financially. I said him that iam not interested in doing job leaving my children. He said ur parents will look after them. So u need not to worry about them. But still Iam not ready to leave them and go for work. My parents are not ready to receive the new parenting strategies we came to know now like understanding ur child and their emotions etc. When I tell them that we have to deal children calmly like this when they don't feel good . My parents just don't want to listen and they will scold and shout at my children sometimes when they don't stop crying my parents shout loudly. This is the reason I just want to parent my children as no one in my family accepts my way of parenting and pressuring me to go for work even after talking multiple times. So is there any guidance I can have from you regarding this. I do want to help my family financially but iam not ready to leave my children at home.I just want to be available for them all the time as long as I can. And also I want to earn money but not by leaving my children and go out for work what should I do. My main pressure is my husband and I had a 17 yr age gap so by the time my children turns 20 he will be 60. So my family is pressuring me even more regarding this. My husband has a huge credit card debt from past 5 years also had a heart stroke once. So he always has a fear that if he will die suddenly how can I look after my children without job.Even after all these reasons I still just not ready to leave my children I just want to see them grow and be a part of their life by following gentle concious parenting approach. My parents don't know about these strategies when we were little and also they are not ready to accept these methods now. Please suggest me something so that I can have a clear viewBecause of my parents pressure I joined online coaching for govt job but iam not at all interested. Even if I say NO my parents will say that there will be huge financial problems for ur children they won't have a good life u will be on streets like that so i don't know what to doLikeForwardCopyReportPlease help me with any advice if u can.","completion":"Priyanka ji, I can understand your dilemma. You will have to find the answer yourself to this. In your place I would have told myself - I am so lucky that I have a family and children I love. i am in a good place. And I might have for now tried doing something part time - may be teaching - may be something else from home which would give me time with kids and a way towards earning some money (if you think the family needs that). Also one way to solve for any untoward event is to have a term life policy, so that in case the bread winner of the family isn't there, children won't suffer. But you have to find your own way.

Give him a hug, love and say no firmly but calmly. If you get agitated and the child is able to get a reaction out of you, he will continue. Also children are supposed to be active - if you feel he is 'hyper active' you can try- getting to bed on time so that he gets enough sleep, the more sleep he gets the better the brain grows- take him outdoors more often (i don't know what is his current outdoor time)- in general say less no to him, set some clear rules of the house but otherwise just observe over interfere"}

You can just put his food and he can come back and eat. you can help him put food himself. And let him move about and eat at his own pace. If the child is hungry the child will come and eat.

My husband feels I am making him more weak and sensitive what's why he needs me to protect him and this is making me worry","completion":"Hi Dr Pratisha, our children crying can affect us a lot. That's normal. But kids biting is normal behaviour as they don't know how to control their emotion. Can happen to anyone. So that's ok. To make him strong, he needs love. The more stable his relationship with you is the better is able to face the world. And you have a lot of time to make it happen. How you have described it already looks like he feels secure so that's great.\n\n\nOverprotection can lead to that. But from what you have told me you don't seem to be doing that. We don't need to rush to protect our children. It is imp to believe that children can take care of themselves and that it is ok to fall and learn.

{"prompt":"Dear Harpreeth, We have a toddler (daughter) who is aged 2.9 Yrs undergoing a rough phase. The issue is that,\n1. We had a nanny - 21 Yrs (Rohini) with whom our daughter enjoyed a lot, playing, signing, dancing etc. The nanny (Rohini) was also good and she played with her nicely\n2. Unfortunately, she ended up leaving because of her personal problems & there was no clear closure for my daughter. The nanny was a live-in nanny.\n3. Even today my daughter recalls the songs that they sang together, cherishes the games they played and remembers her at-least 6-7 times a day\n4. We have replaced her with a nanny, who is much more good but aged around 35 Yrs. But this nanny is a day nanny, comes at 10 and leaves at 7. Its more than 1.5 months and my daughter has not adjusted to the new nanny. She gets irritated and reluctant to play or move with her. She has become clingy to me and my wife.\n5. I am clueless, what to do? Can you please help us out.\nIn case, if you can be reached out through phone and provide a consultancy that would be great. Will wait for your reply.","completion":"Hi PreethamI don't do consultations personallybut if you can share which city you are in, I can share some counsellors who might be able to helpin my view: there was a change - the child will take time to adjust - we have to give the child that time. What the child wants till then is security - which she is getting from you and your wife. The more you offer that, the more secure she will feel which is what is imp for her well beingA young child becoming clingy to her parents is normal, isn't it?A parent not being ok with it and wanting their child to be clingy to someone else, that though has become popular, isn't normal. Isn't it?LikeForwardCopyUnsendMy personal view is you should be happy your nanny went away. It has given you a chance to bond with your daughter, something if you and your wife do now, you will be thankful for years later"}

One who has sincere knowledgeable content that one wants to know more about.One thing that struck me about your profile is you talk about being curious parent. I agree that it is more important in parentingBut I am finding challenge in something else with my babyMy baby is 17 month old. And he doesn't play much with anything. Even like kitchen utensils. Even if I open drawers for him. He would like say just take out one thing and then shut the drawers. Similarly he doesn't show interest in most of the things.

{"prompt":"How to tackle kids if they are hitting or hurting the younger brother","completion":"When a younger child comes, naturally parents’ attention moves to the new child. This can cause anxiety and a lack of connection with the older child. His brain starts to think of the younger child as a competitor. And hitting starts.\nIn this case, spending 1 on 1 time with the older child is key to making him feel secure.\nSo the answer lies not in scolding him or punishing him but in giving him more love. The older child is the one who actually needs more love from the parent"}

{"prompt":"Hello Harpreet, I too had dug in deep but this was 1-2 years ago and hence i don't have any citations at the moment.

Exposure to a lot of TV or online content that is meant for adults.\n3.

There wre times when I took away all the toys with wheels so that he learns to play with other things as well and after an year of understanding I realised this obsession won’t go away , I have to give him cars. Today he is in love with mechanics of cars ,trains ,lifts , aeroplanes. He is turning 3 next month and I don’t know to nurture this obsession.

And you should nurture his loveHe is young so nurturing means allowing him to play. Not buying new cars, new toys all the time. But allowing him to play with whatever he chooses to with. You can go in multiple directions. You can get him actual car parts, bike parts to play with, you can take him to musems which talk about transportation. You can get him to sit in a road roller, you can take his help to change tyre of the car or scooter. He can get real tools like a mechanic. You can use cardboard and make a toy car with him, you can see if likes seeing F1 race or go carting tracks. There are lot of ways to nurture his love. It is through this sense of agency that he will develop concentration that will be useful for everything he does in life. And he might not learn to write cat first but will learn to write tractor, aeroplane all because he loves cars. You can use it for teaching almost anything.LikeForwardCopyUnsendI hope this helps"}

{"prompt":"Hi sir\nI've recently started following you, everyone's parenting is different and every advise doesn't work for all kids....\nPlease share your thoughts on this 👇\nMy daughter is 9, we live with our parents (in-laws), they are typical punjabi grandparents - loud, nagging, shouting, correcting all the time.\nMy father in-law is to much protective for my son(4 yrs) and scolds my daughter too much if they are paying, or fighting or various lil things tat siblings do....then he complaints us abt her.\nWe both are working but still we give enough time n attrition to kids.\nMy biggest fear is tat these things can permanently change my daughter's behaviour, she'll turn bitter, stubborn, cold hearted towards her brother.\nWe tried to make parents understand wat they are doing....but they just dont seem to be interested in improving anything.","completion":"thank you for sharing this. My personal view is: interfering between children is mostly not required. They are brother and sister. At no point should any of them start feeling: I get scolded because of my sibling. And that is prevented if adults don't interfere.It can be hard to change our parents. But the cost for it is too high.You could publicly in front of your daughter say to elders politely - let them play. ,My daughter loves her brother, so don't please interfere between them. She will then know her mother understands.👍I am just sharing something that I would do. But this can be hard.Either ways my priority would have been my daughter rather than trying to correct adultsLikeForwardCopyUnsendLiving in a joint family offers you the chance to work obviously so there are always positives and negatives\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Co7CvllIXwy/"}

{"prompt":"Hi harpreet! Have been following you for quite some time. I really like your content and find it true, relatable and reasonable. Here I would like to share my situation with you so you could do some content on the same.So I am a mother to a three year old. My husband is an alcohol addict. This led to too many unhappy and fight scenes which my son witnessed. He saw me being physically, verbally And emotionally abused by his father. He is aware that something is not right with his dad and that what he is doing is not right, yet he loves him alot.Now I am not living with that man any more. It has been 4 months now. Initially I used to make him talk to his father over video callsLikeForwardCopyReportBut then he started throwing emotional drama in front of the child and I saw him getting uncomfortable song his dad's expressions. So now I have reduced the frequency of those calls to about 1 call every 10 days.Now in this situation one thing that I have noticed and I need your help on is that... my child is going in a shell. He is getting very aggressive, silent and confused. He knows what he likes and what he wants and when I get him something of his interest, or make him do an activity that he enjoys, he always restrains simply to show his disagreement with me overall.How do you think this situation should be dealt with?I want my child to be happy and comfortable. I also want him to get the right values in life.","completion":"Hi, thank you for sharing what you have sharedthis must be hardbut none of us need to be in an abusive relationshipMy personal suggestion is that your child has seen lot of change. And this can be hard for the child's developing brain. My recommendation is to be loving with him. All research says it needs only 1 loving adult to raise a happy child.So you can 100% do it. He might be in a shell and it might take time but if you can be loving and joyful, he will see it and be tooLikeForwardCopyUnsendYou can also try taking therapy for yourself or your son.

A child throws things because they have just discovered gravity, not because they want to upset mother so we can make a bucket of things to throws. She wants to play with water, let her- take her outdoors and let her beIf you can step back and observe, then this will be a boon for your child and you will also change as a person and have less stress :-)Wishing you the very best"}

That she knows she can do what she wants to do. But she is not a kid kid now, so if you start doing it today, it might take 1 day or a few months to emergefor e.g. which classes does she go to, does she choose herself or are they chosen for her?

{"prompt":"Hi, I have been following your content and appreciate your work!\nI am mother to a 3 yr old girl. We recently enrolled her for swimming summer camp for 15 days. We have in the past seen her enjoy water, in a natural stream and at home. However, at the camp with new people and at the pool, she has been reluctant to step into the water or follow the coach. She cries for the entire 1 hour that she is there. I have to be by her side constantly and negotiate. She screams and cries that she is afraid. Its been a week now since she joined. While we are not comparing how other children have progressed. We just don't know how to make her feel comfortable. We don't want to give up. Perhaps its more about our ambition than hers.\nI heard from other parents in my peer that they have faced similar situations of dislike with their children when they were sent to classes for the activities those kids generally liked and were good at.\nDo you have any insights on that?\n\nThank you for taking time to respond!EnterJyoti NairI will do the needful :)\n\nHi, I thought you may like to know this update.\nTaking your advice we enrolled her out of the camp. We took her to the pool yesterday and she transformed to 'Jalpari' refusing to leave the pool. Our heart was filled with joy.\nThank you!","completion":"3 year old's shouldn't be sent to classes mostly. They haven't developed the capacity to listen and understand and follow instructions. Only the gentlest teachers might work but they need to be world class. Your daughter loves water. You have mistaken it for teaching swimming. You can enroll her out or she might not want to play in water!\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Hi Harpreet,\nHope you are doing well!\nI'm a big fan of your podcast and keep re-listening to it for different perspectives and endorse it within my circle of friends. I firmly believe parenting is subject of continuous learning and advocate it as much as I can! Thank you for what you do - you are truly creating an impact!\nWas a bit curious [staying true to the podcast ;) ], your last episode came out in April, more episodes en route? If yes, hope you don't mind me taking the liberty of suggesting a topic - would love an episode / hear your thoughts on gentle parenting.\nOnce again, thank you for all you do & keep helping us parents with your learnings & nuggets of knowledge :)\nPS: If you plan to do a meetup / host a VC, I would love to be a part of it!\nRegards,\nManu\n\n\nThank you for the response, Harpreet. I'm actually not on Insta though I'm upto speed with the shorts you upload on YouTube.\nPodcast ka maza thoda alag hai and hence asked :)\nYes, my wife & I are of the same opinion on firm parenting however, the fad these days & everyone around is into gentle parenting. Kids know they won't be \"bossed\" around and get away with whatever they do & want. Once they all grow up, while our kids are obedient and understand when said 'no' to, their peers may not necessarily. I often ponder on whether the obedient ones will get bullied by the other bunch while growing up & in the real world - given they are sort of given the freedom to act however they want without consequences\n\nThis makes a lot of sense, I'll keep in mind the 1% parenting. Also, I'm not quite able to understand the \"A child who can do whatever they want whenever they want is not equal to a confident child\" but that's food for thought for me - good topic to ponder & discuss on.\nThanks as always, Harpreet! Keep up the good work. If in future you need any help or I can contribute to the curious parent, please please do let me know :)","completion":"• Hi Manu\n• Good to hear from you\n• Yaar gentle parenting I haven’t studied. But I shall check\n• I think it is imp to be firm\n• Firm with love is the holy grail\nIf you are on Instagram take a look at the handle there\n\nI think there will be consequences. Just that the consequences are long term and more difficult to manage. For e.g. screen time leading to under developed brain. A child who can do whatever they want whenever they want is not equal to a confident child. Also firm with love parent does not mean an obedient child. If we are taking all decisions for kids then it could lead to a child who is meek. But if we are doing 1% parenting i.e. taking the most critical decisions, then the child should be able to preserve her/his sense of agency while understanding their place in the family."}
